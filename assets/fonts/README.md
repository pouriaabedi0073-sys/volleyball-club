This folder should contain the real Vazirmatn WOFF2 font file named `vazirmatn.woff2`.

Place the official font file at:

  assets/fonts/vazirmatn.woff2

The file in the repository is intentionally omitted for licensing reasons. Replace it with the real WOFF2 file you have (from your assets-offline.zip) so the app renders correctly offline.
